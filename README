Hello.

This is an old hack that clones the Future Crew MDP player interface.
It was writen in February 1997 and revised in July and December of the
same year, for xmp 1.1. When rediscovered, mdp.c was last touched in
December 15th, 1997. Only a couple of adjustments were needed to make
it work with the current xmp code.

The code is supposed to work with SVGAlib as well but I believe it's
all but extinct by now, so let's stay with the X11 version that still
works quite nicely. It's interesting to see it playing Skaven's remakes
of old classics in IT format.

To build xmdp, tweak the Makefile as needed (yeah, like in old days!).

Want to finish it to make a full MDP clone? Send me the patch!

Cheers,
