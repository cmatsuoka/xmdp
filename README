Hi,

So here's xmdp again, this time built using libxmp 4.2. It was initially
written in 1997 with a revision in 2005, and in this incarnation it still
doesn't have a file browser (so it's not, despite the name, a real
musicdisk player).

Those who were around back in 1993 will recognize xmdp as something that
looks like Future Crew's MusicDiskPlayer. MDP was distributed with Purple
Motion's Journey I and II, and Skaven's Chaotic Mind musicdisks.

Xmdp is being published mostly as an example of an application using libxmp.
It can become more intersting once it becomes a full MDP clone (so maybe one
day we can have it loading the original MDI files and playing the old DOS
musicdisks). [Feb/2016 update: Yay! 19 years later, I finally added MDI file
parsing and a menu mode, so you finally have your full MDP clone.]

Until then, it's only a retro-looking module player.

Enjoy!
