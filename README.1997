xmdp and smdp are X11 and SVGAlib clones of Future Crew's MusicDisk Player
(MDP). They show how to use shared memory to create a graphic frontend for
xmp. xmdp and smdp are NOT (at least in this version) a  complete clone of
MDP. There's NO module selector and mdp.mdi files will NOT be read.


Installation:

To compile and  run [sx]mdp you will need  xmp 1.1.0. smdp will require a
recent  version of the SVGAlib (version 1.2.10 recommended;  S3 805 cards
may not work with older versions).
